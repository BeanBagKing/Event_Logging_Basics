[Work In Progress]This is the start of a collection on what you might want to log in your environment. I'm starting this because I often see the question asked: "What should I log?", maybe for centralized collection, maybe for a SIEM, maybe for compliance. The reply is often that Microsoft defaults aer terribe, but it depends on your environment and your needs, followed sometimes by a list of technet articles.

This isn't incorrect advice (especally for compliance), but it's completely useless to most people just stepping into a security or sysadmin role. People need a place to start, a good foundation for what should be logged, which they can then tune to their own environment.

Each section will (eventually/hopefully) contain four sections
- What should be logged (Event ID/Description)
- Details (What it contains, why it should be enabled, if it's enabled by default)
- Where to turn it on
- References

There are more experianced people out there than I am. There are things I may not include if I don't see them as important, but they may be vital in your environment. The typical advice given, know your environment and needs, still stands. I hope this gives some people a foundation though.
